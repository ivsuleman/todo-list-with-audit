## Please consider:
- Validations has to be setup for each functionalities/properties that you judge needed.
- Any record have to be stored to be able to be played. We let you choose the storage.
- The SPA will have to propose a basic/responsive/professional design. Weâ€™re not asking the SPA to be all devices/browser compatible but we like to check that your CSS is responsive by resizing the browser.
- If you want, you can use a css library such as Bootstrap.
- Do not use any scaffold to generate your SPA scaffold i.e create-react-app. You have to write your webpack file(s)/structure your solution by yourself.
- You can not use any project you may find for creating the TO DO SPA. Try to develop it without any help.
